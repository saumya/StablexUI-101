StablexUI 101
================
While playing with this library it seems, the library is only good for `Flash` and `HTML` targets.

In a simple project like this, it fails for `Neko` and `mac`.     

It throws the following errors   

```
malloc: *** error for object 0x102b2eeef: pointer being freed was not allocated
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
```
